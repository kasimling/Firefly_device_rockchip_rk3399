         Otherwise, auto-rotation is disabled.  Applications may still request
         to use specific orientations but the sensor is ignored and sensor-based
         orientations are not available.  Furthermore, all auto-rotation related
         settings are omitted from the system UI.  In certain situations we may
         still use the accelerometer to determine the orientation, such as when
         docked if the dock is configured to enable the accelerometer. -->
